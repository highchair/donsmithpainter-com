## Images Have Scale

It is important to Don Smith that the images of his paitnings are displayed in a way that denotes a relationship between them. A small painting or watercolor should be relatively smaller on screen than any painting over 3 feet wide. 

We have a system in place for relative scale, and this is how it works: 

* xlarge: Anything more than 48" in any dimension
* large: Between 32" and 47" in any direction
* medium: Between 24" and 31" in any direction
* small: Between 16" and  23" in any direction
* tiny: Up to 15" in any direction"

CSS values for the sizes:

* xlarge:
* large: 
* medium:
* small: 
* tiny:
